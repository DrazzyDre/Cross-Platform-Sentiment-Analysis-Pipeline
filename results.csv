1m9nzek,clever-coded,1753517628.0,570,visas,Japan Visa Approved - First time International travellers (from India),"# **Background :**

*Konnichiwa, minnasan!* My brother and I are huge anime fans and have always been fascinated by Japanese culture. Visiting Japan has been a lifelong dream for both of us. With the Osaka World Expo 2025 happening around, we finally decided to make the trip happen and explore Japan for two weeks!

We‚Äôre partners in our family business, and this will be our first-ever international trip. We have no prior travel history.


# **Visa Timeline :**

Our jurisdiction falls under the Chennai Consulate, so we booked our visa appointment at VFS Chennai for July 18.

* **July 18 (Fri) -** Our appointment was scheduled for 11:05 AM, but we arrived early at 9:00 AM. Since we were the first ones there, the VFS staff gave us the first token. They collected our documents, and the entire process took about 30 minutes. We were done by 9:30 AM.
* **July 22 (Tue) -** Received an update that our passports had been forwarded to the Consulate. (Note : July 21 was a Japanese national holiday, hence the delay)
* **July 24 (Thu) -** Got another update that our passports had been processed and sent back.
* **July 26 (Sat) -** Received our passports via courier with [single entry visa](https://www.reddit.com/r/PassportPorn/s/nYM1CeVLUi) **approved**!

‚åõ Total : Just **4 working days** (7 calendar days) between appointment and delivery!


# **Documents Submitted :**

A huge shoutout to fellow Redditor u/ygrules for their [Ultimate Japan Visa Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/1jfjtt8/ultimate_japan_visa_guide_stepbystep_breakdown/) \- it helped us handle the entire process ourselves, without an agent.

Our VFS staff took all the documents submitted.

* **Digitally filled and signed visa application forms**¬†(with photos attached)

* **First and last pages of our passports**¬†(biodata pages)

* **One photograph each**¬†(45mm x 45mm, as per Chennai consulate specs)

* **Individual cover letters**¬†mentioning each other as travel partners

* **Day-wise itinerary**

* **Flight and accommodation bookings**

* **NOC from our father**¬†(company partner), confirming our association with the business and guaranteeing our return, signed and sealed

* **GST certificate**¬†of our company

* **Last 3 months‚Äô bank statements**¬†(each showing closing balance of ‚Çπ4+ lakhs, stamped and signed by bank)

* **Only 1 year of ITR**¬†(each ‚Çπ4+ lakhs for FY 23-24) as we joined the business in 2023, and ITR filing utility for 2024 was not released at the time of our application. We clearly explained this in our cover letters and included additional supporting documents

* **Last 3 years‚Äô Annual Information Statements**¬†(AIS)

* **Last 3 years‚Äô Form 26AS**

* **Travel insurance**¬†for both (coverage up to $50,000)

* **Osaka Expo 2025 tickets**

* **Aadhaar card photocopies**

* **PAN card photocopies**


# **Tips :**

üìå Please don‚Äôt pay anyone online for a cover letter, you‚Äôll find plenty of free samples on the internet. Just follow the [Ultimate Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/visas/comments/1jfjtt8/ultimate_japan_visa_guide_stepbystep_breakdown/), customize it to your case, and you‚Äôll be fine. You don't need an agent, the process may seem intimidating, but it‚Äôs absolutely doable.

üìå Our communication with the Consulate General is only through a **cover letter**, so make sure it clearly explains your situation. In our case, we mentioned why we only had one year of ITR and included other documents proactively. This likely prevented any further delays or document requests from the consulate.


Feel free to DM or comment if you have any questions I'd be happy to help. Wishing you all the best on your Japan visa journey. Hope everyone gets their visa approved and make their Japan dream trip come true!

1c7qvdm,BangaloreJohnDoe,1713511671.0,68,visas,Japan Visa Application - India Bengaluru/Bangalore,"Hi All,

Thought of posting this as Reddit helped a lot to drive anxiety away during our Japan visa application (which was a success).   
  
First things first, an introduction. We are a married couple who moved to Bangalore, India an year ago (2023) and are both working for private companies with base location in Bengaluru (both the companies are well known). Both our passports are **not** from Karnataka but we have a valid rent agreement and gas bills. Decided to apply for Japan visa towards end of March 2024 with the intention of travelling during April last week.

Details are as follows :-

1. Prior to the visa application, we had booked non-refundable round trip flight tickets (one can choose otherwise as well but this was cheaper by a country mile as an option) and fully cancellable hotel accommodations
2. Application is only accepted at VFS Bangalore. Appointments are necessary and for us we could get a slot the very next day. We applied on 4th April for a single entry tourist visa and went for the traditional offline mode although E-Visa facilities for Indians started on 1st April.
3. For the application we submitted all the listed documents on the VFS page **some of which are** the following :-
   1. 2 application letters for myself and my wife¬†***(Form downloaded from VFS site and hand-filled. We faced some issues in even downloading the form)***. We also attached one recent photo as per specifications mentioned on the VFS site¬†***(Specification on Japan visa official site differs but we stuck to VFS specifications).***¬†Two call-outs for filling the application form - Adahar ID number was what we inputed in the country ID column and for stay we only mentioned the first hotel which we had booked for the trip.
   2. 1 joint cover letter stating the purpose of the visit, our details, our travel history and a list of supporting that we had taken as per the list of the document. In the cover letter, we had mentioned that both of us were self sufficient in terms of finances and only one of us signed the cover letter.¬†***(Disclaimer : I have read that both need to sign at the end and if one is sponsoring the other's trip then that needs to be called out also)***
   3. Leave certificate (Original on respective company's letter head) from our companies mentioned the leave duration, start date, end date, return date and employee number. The HR who signs the document also provided their contact details at the end.
   4. Rent Agreement¬†***(where both our names were mentioned)***¬†and gas bills which was on one of our's name
   5. Schedule of stay mentioning the activity that we had planned, hotel details of the day, area and hotel contact number of each particular date that we intended to spend in Japan. We copied a format available online through a quick google search
   6. Round trip flight tickets and hotel accommodation proofs validating the schedule of stay. 
   7. Financial capability proof - We submitted bank statements of 6 months (we had downloaded the online version of the bank statements and mentioned the same in the cover letter although for safety, one should attest it from the bank), payslips for 3 months, ITR acknowledgment one pager for 2 years. 
   8. Valid passports (expiring in 2026) with 5 blank pages each
   9. Marriage certificate¬†***(Disclaimer : We have heard that for Japan, even a wedding card is fine if you do not have a marriage certificate)***
   10. Some additional documents as per the VFS site (Do not remember attaching any further document but posting it here so that the reader goes back to VFS site to check the updated list of documents required)
4. At the visa application center, we reached as per our booked time (but to me personally it did not seem that any time mattered) and was more of a serial number as per when you reached the centre. We waited for 30 minutes before our number came up. The VFS representative saw all our documents and discarded a few¬†**(PAN Card, Adhaar card copy).**¬†Then he gave us a handwritten slip to deposit the money at the counter which was Rs 3700 for both of us including courier charges¬†**(they force you to select courier as the option which I feel was wrong).**¬†We had not taken cash so had to go out and get cash. Once we submitted the challan back to the VFS representative he gave it to his colleague who then took the documents to a separate room where he processed our application and gave us a receipt for application submission.
5. Then it was a waiting game. The VFS team did send us email notifications throughout the process but once it reached the consulate the VFS team had no visibility. Neither calling the embassy was of any help. Mostly one needs to wait although things were efficient.
6. Visa process :-
   1. Submitted at VFS office, Bengaluru - 4th April, 2024 (1:30 pm)
   2. VFS office sent an acknowledgement mail - 5th April, 2024
   3. VFS office sent a couple of other notifications including one where they said that the consulate has received our application - 5th April, 2024
   4. Saturday (6th, 13th), Sunday (7th, 14th), Tuesday (9th), Thursday (11th) were non-working days at the consulate and at VFS because of weekends and regional/national holidays
   5. Received a notification that our processed passports were being couriered back to us - 15th April, 2024. From here on onwards, you can track the details by putting in your reference number ending with the slash just before the serial number of the application - ex - JPN/BLR/000000/00000/ (***Disclaimer***¬†***- We did not track the courier and we have just read the method online although if you call VFS on the day after you receive the notification they do share the waybill number)***
   6. We received the passport with the visa confirmation - 16th April, 2024
   7. The entire process took 7 working days from submission at vfs office to receiving the passport and 5 working days at the Japan consulate (we may have been lucky but it's what they had communicated as well).

So... I dont agree with waving mexican/colombian/whatever flags at protests. Just like MLK marched peacefully, and African Americans showed by demonstration that they too deserved the right to be treated as equal, so too must immigrants show that us being here is an overall good. ""Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."". Behind every person who strongly dislikes immigration or illegal immigration, is someone who loves and cares for the US. I like to believe the best in people. That hateful rhetoric on either side is fueled by fear of the unknown. I daresay as immigrants we do have to assimilate into the US. Learn the language and foster integration into this society. I hope that we can demonstrate worthiness of citizenship here in the USA, and not lean into the tactics of anger and retaliation. No matter how tense things may be.

-------------------------------------------

Edit 1**thank you to all who are engaging in reasonable dialogue here. There are some comments not made in good faith and I understand this is a public forum and that will happen. Definitely appreciate some of the responses here as well. **

Edit 2***I do understand there is a difference between illegal immigrants and African Americans plight at that time. I dont have time to nuance that as it needs. No disrespect meant. I'm just referring to immigration as a whole, and Dr. King's philosophy for eliciting change, and just his example as a whole of countering injustice, and also proving his opponents wrong with intelligence, peace and responding with good when he encountered hate**

Edit 3** I dont believe this means disregarding your original culture-- note that I specified flags at protests. Not flags in general. We just have to be wise with time, place, and the message we re sending, is all I'm saying.
Its less about the flag, and more about the mindset. The mindset that says ""we are here to do good in this country, in good faith and with respect"". It shows a humble attitude toward the US.**

Edit 4 **My point is not to get hyperfixated on the flag issue. It is the fact that we have to win people over, find some common ground. Appeal to the the good in them. Who is convinced to reconsider their opinion when met with force and demand? We have to learn to disarm conversations and rather educate. And again, prove to people why immigration reform is a good, rational idea. And where hate exists, highlight and expose the nonsense of their hatred by showing that it is against good, intelligent, family-loving, hard-working people, intent on doing good here in this country.**",immigrant waving american flag perhaps truth immigrant asking permission come country dont agree waving mexicancolombianwhatever flag protest like mlk marched peacefully african american showed demonstration deserved right treated equal must immigrant show u overall good hate cannot drive hate love behind every person strongly dislike immigration illegal immigration someone love care u like believe best people hateful rhetoric either side fueled fear unknown daresay immigrant assimilate u learn language foster integration society hope demonstrate worthiness citizenship usa lean tactic anger retaliation matter tense thing may edit thank engaging reasonable dialogue comment made good faith understand public forum happen definitely appreciate response well edit understand difference illegal immigrant african american plight time dont time nuance need disrespect meant im referring immigration whole dr king philosophy eliciting change example whole countering injustice also proving opponent wrong intelligence peace responding good encountered hate edit dont believe mean disregarding original culture note specified flag protest flag general wise time place message sending im saying less flag mindset mindset say good country good faith respect show humble attitude toward u edit point get hyperfixated flag issue fact win people find common ground appeal good convinced reconsider opinion met force demand learn disarm conversation rather educate prove people immigration reform good rational idea hate exists highlight expose nonsense hatred showing good intelligent familyloving hardworking people intent good country,neutral,0.5204232931137085,"{'negative': 0.38485613465309143, 'neutral': 0.5204232931137085, 'positive': 0.09472059458494186}",anger,0.9661915898323059,"{'anger': 0.9661915898323059, 'disgust': 0.0007586788269691169, 'fear': 0.020570475608110428, 'joy': 0.006941412575542927, 'neutral': 0.002521033398807049, 'sadness': 0.001249960158020258, 'surprise': 0.0017668744549155235}","flag, protest, immigrant, immigration, injustice","As immigrants, we are asking permission to come into this country.

1ltwq8e,Just_Random_input,1751901123.0,2013,immigration,Anyone else sick of Americans who migrate calling themselves ‚ÄúExpats‚Äù instead of immigrants?,"A lot of Americans are (or are talking about) moving abroad in response to the current political environment in the United States. 

I‚Äôm irked by the fact that we refer to people migrating to the USA as immigrants who ‚Äúcame here‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but we refer to our own migration as ‚ÄúAmeriExit‚Äù or ‚Äúmoving abroad‚Äù and we refer to ourselves as ‚Äúexpats‚Äù or ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù

I‚Äôve met a ton of people who call themselves digital nomads who are technically illegal immigrants, overstaying tourist visa‚Äôs and joking that can afford the fine if they get caught. Even the ones that I met who obtained digital nomad visa‚Äôs were neglecting to pay legally mandated taxes to their host country which is so nasty considering those taxes are a write-off on their US taxes. They take advantage of that country‚Äôs resources without contributing. I saw a lot of this South America - in exactly the same countries we bitch about for doing this to us. 

Americans move abroad for the same reason people move to the USA:  for a better life. Portugal & South East Asia are becoming inundated with ‚Äúexpats‚Äù. As is Dubai, Portugal & many other countries. A better could mean: economically better, or politically better, or better healthcare, weather, cost of living, etc. but either way, we aren‚Äôt moving to live a worse life so, by definition, we are moving for a better one. 

Words can be powerful. Even though you can argue that it‚Äôs only semantics, I feel we are doing everyone a disservice with this ‚Äútwo-faced‚Äù verbiage. 

Do you think that people would look at immigrants differently if all these YouTubers, influencers & news articles referred to Americans moving abroad as ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù?

1mpfik6,usatoday,1755116570.0,632,immigration,New data show the US's immigrant population declining dramatically.,"Hey r/immigration, Kevin from USA TODAY here. The country's immigrant population may have dropped by roughly 2 million people in the first six months of the year, according to new government data. That's the largest such drop in a single year in three decades.

The new data offer an early ‚Äì if imperfect ‚Äì signal that President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown may already be showing an impact.

Good to keep in mind: Between the Trump administration's sprawling crackdown on illegal immigration and the onslaught of zero-tolerance messaging, it's possible that some survey respondents are now too scared to tell the government whether they or members of their household are immigrants.

ICE has reported 246,000 removals so far this fiscal year, which began in October 2024 and ends Sept. 30 and includes more than three months of data under the Biden administration.

But some other immigrants, here legally or illegally, have chosen to return voluntarily to their home countries. If the population survey is an accurate count, it would represent a mass exodus.

We've been getting many of the same questions about whether it's safe to travel in/out of the US, and this megathread consolidates those questions.

The following FAQ answers the most common questions, and is correct as of Jun 4, 2025.

If the FAQ does not answer your question, feel free to leave your question as a comment on this thread.

# US citizens

### QC1. I am a US citizen by birth/adopted, is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

Yes, it is safe, and you have a clear constitutional right to re-enter the US.

When entering or exiting the US by air, you must always do so with a US passport or NEXUS card (Canada only).

At the border, CBP cannot deny you entry. However, if your US citizenship is in question or you are uncooperative, they could place you in secondary processing to verify your citizenship, which can take 30 mins to a few hours depending on how busy secondary is. 

As part of their customs inspection, CBP can also search your belongings or your electronic devices. You are not required to unlock your device for them, but they can also seize your electronic devices for a forensic search and it may be some time (weeks/months) before you get them back.


### QC2. I am a US citizen by naturalization, is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

The answer to QC1 mostly applies to you.

However, in the some of the following situations, it may be possible to charge you with denaturalization:

1. If you committed any immigration fraud prior to, or during naturalization. Common examples include using a fake name, failure to declare criminal records, fake marriages, etc or otherwise lying on any immigration form.

2. If you are an asylee/refugee, but traveled to your country of claimed persecution prior to becoming a US citizen.

3. If your green card was mistakenly issued (e.g. priority date wasn't current, or you were otherwise ineligible) and N-400 subsequently mistakenly approved, the entire process can be reversed because you were not eligible for naturalization.

Denaturalization is very, very rare. The US welcomes nearly a million US citizens every year, but we've probably only see around 10 denaturalizations a year on average.

### QC3. I am a US dual citizen, and my other country of nationality may be subject to a travel ban. Is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

Answer QC1 applies. Travel bans cannot be applied to US citizens, even if you are dual citizens of another country.

# Permanent Residents / Green Card Holders

### QG1. I am a US green card holder, is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

You are generally safe to travel as long as all the following applies:

1. You are a genuine resident of the US. This means that you are traveling abroad temporarily (less than 6 months), and you otherwise spend most of every year (> 6 months) in the US.

2. You do not have a criminal record (except for traffic violations like speeding, parking, etc).

3. You have not ever committed any immigration fraud.

4. You have not ever expressed support for a terrorist organization designated by the Department of State, which includes Hamas.

Your trips abroad should not exceed 6 months or you will be considered to be seeking admission to the US and many of the protections guaranteeing green card holders re-entry no longer apply to you.

CBP has been pressuring green card holders to sign an I-407 to give up their green cards if they find that you've violated any of the above, especially if you spend very little time in the US or very long absences abroad. 

Generally, you are advised not to sign it (unless you're no longer interested in remaining a green card holder). However, keep in mind that even if you refuse to sign it, CBP can still place you in removal proceedings where you have to prove to an immigration judge that you're still a genuine resident of the US / you have not committed a serious crime rendering you eligible for deportation. While waiting for your day in court, CBP can place you in immigration detention (jail). You may wish to consider your odds of winning in mind before traveling.

### QG2. I am a conditional US green card holder (2 years), is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

You are treated exactly like a green card holder, so every other answer in this section applies equally to you. 

If your GC has expired, your 48 month extension letter and expired green card is valid for re-entry when presented together. Other countries that grant visa-free entry or transit to green card holders may not recognize an extension letter for those visa-free benefits, however.

### QG3. I am a US green card holder with a clean criminal and immigration record, traveling for a vacation abroad for a few weeks. Is it safe to travel?

Per QG1, you're safe to travel.

### QG4. I am a US green card holder with a country of nationality of one of the potential travel ban countries.  Is it safe to travel in/out of the US?

The latest Jun 2025 travel ban exempts US green card holders.

Past Trump travel bans have all exempted US green card holders. 

It is extremely unlikely that any travel bans will cover green card holders.


# US ESTA/Tourist Visa Holders

### QT1. I am a tourist traveling to the US with an approved ESTA/B visa. Is it safe to travel?

Yes, it is generally safe to travel. 

CBP is enforcing these existing rules for tourist travel more strictly, so keep these in mind:

1. You must not try to live in the US with a tourist visa. In general, avoid trip plans that span the entire validity of your tourist visa (90 days for ESTA or 180 days for B-2), as this is a red flag if you're either planning that on your current trip or have done so on a previous trip. As another rule, you should spend 1-2 days outside the US per day inside before returning to the US.

2. You must have strong ties to your home country. This is particularly relevant for those with US citizen/green card partners, children or parents. These relationships are considered a strong tie to the US, so you must be ready to convince CBP that you will leave: long-held job in home country, spouse or kids in home country, etc. Those with strong ties to the US should generally try to limit their travel to the US to shorter durations for lower risk.

3. You must not try to work in the US, even remotely for a foreign employer paid to a foreign bank account. While checking emails or business mettings is certainly fine, you cannot actually perform work. While some have gotten away with it in the past, it is unwise to try when CBP has been clamping down.

4. If any answers to your ESTA or tourist visa eligibility questions change, e.g. if you've acquired a new criminal record, traveled to a banned country (e.g. Cuba/North Korea/etc), you need to apply for a new ESTA or tourist visa.

### QT2. I am a tourist who visits the US for at most a few weeks a year, for genuine tourism. Is it safe to travel?

Yes, per QT1, it is safe to travel.

### QT3. I am a tourist from a country that is one of the potential travel ban countries. Is it safe to travel?

It is safe to travel while the travel ban has not been announced or in force.

However, for those planning trips in the future, these travel bans have sometimes applied to those who already hold tourist visas. These travel bans also often give very little advance notice (few days to a week).

It may not be wise to plan travel to the US if you're from one of the potential banned countries, as your travel may be disrupted. If you really wish to travel, you should buy refundable tickets and hotels.

### QT4. I am visiting the US, do I need to perform any sort of registration before/after entry?

To travel to the US as a tourist, you generally need an ESTA or visa, unless you're a Canadian or CFA national.

Upon entry with an ESTA or visa, you will be granted an electronic I-94, which will serve as your alien (foreign national) registration until the expiration date listed on the elecronic I-94.

You can find your most recent I-94 on the official website: https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/

If you're NOT issued an I-94, typically for Canadian citizens visiting, and you wish to stay in the US for more than 30 days, you must register. 

Follow the instructions on https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration to create a USCIS account and electronically file form G-325R. 

# US Student/Work/Non-Tourist Visa or Advance Parole Holders

### QR1. I have a US student, work or other non-tourist visa/advance parole. Is it safe to travel?

There are many risk factors when traveling as a visa holder living in the US. 

Unlike a tourist whose denial of entry simply means a ruined vacation, the stakes are a lot higher if your entire life/home is in the US but you cannot return. The conservative advice here is to avoid travel unless necessary.

You should absolutely avoid travel if ANY of the following applies to you:

1. If your country of nationality is on one of the rumored travel ban lists, you should avoid travel. It is possible, and legal, for travel bans to apply to existing visa holders - even those that live in the US. This has happened before in some of Trump's previous travel bans. If you must travel, you need to accept the risk that you may be left stranded abroad as travel bans can be announced and take effect on the same day.

2. If you have a criminal record (excluding minor traffic offenses) such as drugs, theft, drunk driving, or more serious crimes, do not travel. F-1 students have had their visas and status revoked for past criminal records (even in the 2010s), and it can expand to other visa types at any time. There is no statute of limitations - it does not matter how long in the past this criminal record is.

3. If you have participated in a protest or expressed support for a terrorist organization designated by the Department of State, including Hamas, do not travel. The Trump administration has been cracking down on visa holder participants, and while the constitutionality of such a crack down is still unclear, you probably don't want to be the martyr fighting the case from immigration detention or from abroad after being denied entry.

# General Questions

### QA1. Are there any airports safer to travel with?

Each airport has dozens to hundreds of CBP officers and there is some luck involved depending on who you get. You'll definitely find stories of how someone had a bad CBP experience at every single airport, but also find stories about how someone had a good CBP experience at every single airport.

There's generally no ""better"" or ""worse"" airport.

### QA2. Is preclearance in another country (e.g. Dublin) better than traveling to the US?

There's a tradeoff.

The whole point of preclearance is to make it easier for CBP to deny entry, because you're not on US soil and there's no cost to detain or arrange you on a flight back - they can just deny boarding. Furthermore, as you're not on US soil, even US citizens and permanent residents can be denied boarding.

On the other hand, while CBP at preclearance can cancel or confiscate your visa/green card, they generally cannot detain you in a foreign country.

Thus, if you're willing to increase the odds of being denied entry to reduce the odds of being detained, preclearance is better for you.

### Final Remarks

While there has been a genuine increase in individuals being denied entry or detained, the absolute numbers are very small overall. To put in perspective, the US processes on the order of a million+ entries across every port each day, all of whom enter and exit the US without issue. Statistically speaking, your odds of being denied entry if you have no negative criminal or immigration history mentioned above is virtually nil.",megathread faq travel inout united state update jun

1go1txh,AtypicalCommonplace,1731248875.0,847,immigration,Thoughts from a (FORMER) immigration attorney who did a LOT of work post 2016,"**Disclaimer: This DOES NOT constitute legal advice**. I am not your lawyer nor am I anyone's lawyer. I am simply sharing my personal thoughts as someone who was an immigration lawyer (mainly for children and DV survivors) for 10+ years. In the wake of 2016 I spent most of 2017 traveling around the US advising folks on their rights, offering consultations, and training allies on what they could do. I am NO longer practicing and can't answer any individual questions in chat or DM's about your specific case and I apologize about that in advance. 

So, with that being said, here are some things I've been thinking and sharing with folks who have asked, in case it is helpful to any of you. 

**1) We have no idea what will happen.** 

Take a deep breathe because no one, and I mean no one has any idea what will actually occur on Jan 21st. We know there is a desire for mass raids from folks who will be in power. 

 We know there are governors who have said they will ""use every tool at their disposal"" to fight against any attempted mass deportations. 

We know there are constitutional protections in place (and yes, many aspects of the Constitution protect you even if you aren't a citizen).

Yet - we **also** know there are examples of horrific events like that that have happened throughout history regardless of what protections are in place.  

These are just the facts. The reality is we are all clueless and guessing and anyone who says they know anything else for sure or can guarantee you XYZ will or won't happen is deluding you and/or themselves. It is important to know that nothing is known. 

  
**2) There will be MANY vile, opportunistic immigration ""lawyers"" who come out of the woodwork**

Immigration lawyers are some of the best and worst lawyers I have ever met. Because so many undocumented folks are desperate, because they are then afraid to report lawyers who took advantage of them, because immigration law is (purposefully) ridiculously complicated and there are endless loopholes and pitfalls and it all comes down to discretion anyways, ***be incredibly wary of private immigration lawyers charging a fee right now.*** Again, there are a LOT of brilliant, wonderful, ethical immigration lawyers who charge thousands and do it right. 

Unfortunately, I would say they can be the exception, not the rule. I've seen immigration lawyers who work with human traffickers, immigration lawyers who lie to their clients to apply for a ""work permit"" when they're actually lining them up for deportation proceedings by promising the work permit on a false claim (because then they can charge court fees too!). The list goes on and on. 

I have reason to think a LOT of slimey folks are in this sub based on what I've observed being downvoted in the past couple of days (curious how this post will go). 

NEVER trust a lawyer who says they can ""guarantee"" anything. Immigration is discretionary and no they cannot.   
NEVER trust a lawyer who says it will be ""simple."" Again, it COULD be simple. But if they say it DEFINITELY will be that is a lie. 

NEVER trust a lawyer who does not advise you on the CONSEQUENCES of filing an application (more on that below). They should counsel you on all possible risks, all possible negative outcomes, and all possible consequences of submitting anything to USCIS, DHS, or anywhere else. YOU are the only one who can decide what is right for you but you can ONLY do that if you have full knowledge of what could be at stake. Not for scare tactics, for the reality of allowing you to make the best choice for your family. 

  
**3) If you aren't on immigration's ""radar"", submitting paperwork is like putting up a sign that says, ""heyo, I'm here!""** 

Submitting paperwork to immigration means reporting your address, getting your fingerprints taken, listing family members, etc etc. One of the most heartbreaking things during DACA was that many people were NOT counseled on the fact that submitting paperwork means making a record of yourself with the federal government that they can trace and follow. Which, of course, is worth it for millions and millions of people.  But again, you should know and be aware of this so you can make an INFORMED choice of what is right for YOU and YOUR family. 

It is my OPINION that you want to think especially hard about this if you are applying for something that just basically puts you in a very long line but doesn't grant any sort of status right away. Be very cautious and talk and think through all possibilities before determining if it is right for you. 

  
**4) Reminder - THERE IS NO ""PATH"" TO LEGAL IMMIGRATION STATUS IN THE US**

Yes, there are ""paths"" for folks who fit into certain categories. They can be over simplified and broken into three categories:

*  Are you rich or skilled? 
* Do you have immediate relatives who are USC or LPR with ten billion asterisks attached? 
* Has some really horrible shit happened to you and are you willing to report it/talk about it and is it the right kind of horrible shit). 

That's it folks. And this can't be shared enough because the narrative out there is WILD about folks having to do it the ""right way"" when that's just not real. I have met hundreds of folks who have lived here for decades, have filed taxes, have US citizen children, who have never been arrested, etc etc etc and for whom there is NO PATH and NO WAY to do anything ""legally."" Oh and by the way all my great great grandparents had to do was get in a boat and sign a piece of paper. So let's not pretend that we're all over here high and mighty when the rules have changed. 

  
**5) If it were my family, I would begin safety planning** 

Not to panic. Not to begin leaving life in fear. And with the hope in your mind it will all be for naught and you can laugh in a decade about how worried you were. 

And

I used to run the legal department of a DV agency and the best thing to do when you know there could be risk of danger is to be prepared for what you would do if you need it. 

  
Know where all your important documents and papers are. Get a file with copies and keep it with some cash and a change of clothes in a backpack and/or duffle which you know where it is at all times. If you have a trusted friend or neighbor, talk to them about using their home as a meeting spot should you need to. 

If you are a church community member and feel comfortable, open up to them about being willing to help if a hard moment comes.  I was involved in sanctuary efforts (where undocumented folks take refuge in a religious institution) from 2017-2020 and Churches were one of the only places the administration didn't raid or detain folks in/from. Not saying it is any sort of guarantee, just the reality of what happened before. 

(and side note, if you are an ally reading this who is a part of a religious community please talk to them about looking into becoming a sanctuary church). 

**6) Remember, Hope is a muscle** 

I wish I had better words to say but I try and remind myself of the words of those who came before us and led with light. Look into cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to practice optimism. Sounds F;d, I know, after everything I wrote before, and yet the biggest changes have also happened during repressive moments. There will be pain and needless suffering and cruelty. And we can also deeply wish this is the ""darkness of the womb, and not the darkness of the tomb"" [as spoken by Valerie Kaur](https://valariekaur.com/2016/11/a-sikh-prayer-for-america-on-november-9th-2016/). And we all need to practice that hope now.

Palantir‚Äôs **ImmigrationOS** launches **Sept 25, 2025**, for DHS and ICE. The AI will link and analyze federal data (DHS, FBI, IRS, Social Security, etc.) and some state data (DMV, police data like traffic cameras, etc.), making it nearly impossible to slip through bureaucratic cracks. Expect real-time tracking for self-deportations, visa overstays, and enforcement.  Pending asylum filings can pause some overstay penalties and offer protection, but interviews and denials can drag on for years‚Äîbut denials would be final and trigger removal proceeding.

1lp867u,usatoday,1751391724.0,461,immigration,Assaults on ICE agents surge 700% as immigration enforcement ramps up across the US,"Hey r/immigration, Nikol from USA TODAY here. As the administration's new immigration tactics intensify, it's being met with rising public resistance and desperation from suspects facing ICE detention and deportation. Our reporters Lauren Villagran and Trevor Hughes looked into the rise of assaults on ICE agents. This is an excerpt from their story: 

*Masked agents. Terrified suspects. Emotions running high as screaming crowds press in, cell phone cameras in hand.*

*Amid surging immigration enforcement across the country, federal agents are being hurt and hospitalized as they make increasingly public ‚Äì and risky ‚Äì arrests of people they believe are undocumented immigrants.*

*White House officials say there's been a 700% increase in assaults on agents, as President Donald Trump's massive deportation campaign ramps up.*

*Administration officials say bold tactics are needed to repel what they call an ""invasion"" of immigrants. But policing experts say the aggressive approach is provoking unnecessarily dangerous encounters.*

*...*

*The ICE tactics on display are a dramatic departure from how cautiously ICE agents previously worked, said Jason Houser, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official.*

*Previously, ICE agents prioritized serious criminal offenders for arrest, Houser said. A team of agents might work for days or weeks to surveil a single subject before making an arrest carefully timed to minimize risks to the public and to agents themselves.*

*ICE agents are trained to ""think about prioritization of public safety, risk and removability,"" he added.*

*Internal Justice Department training programs stress that police agencies should focus on de-escalation whenever possible and avoid making arrests in public areas, especially when there's no imminent threat to public safety.*

*""Now we have political quotas: ‚ÄòGive me 3,000 arrests‚Äô (per day). And all gloves are off,"" Houser said. ""It‚Äôs not about public safety any more.""*

Coming back (he claims language/translation issues) they say he told them he lives in Vegas. Coming in on ESTA and leaving to contiguous country for short trip and coming right back probably red flagged her

1i78lmx,Realistic_Bike_355,1737543572.0,431,immigration,Illegal immigration is the Americans' fault,"**Disclaimer**: I lived in the US, but I never immigrated there. I am from, and currently live in, Europe.  
This will be a bit of a rant, but I feel like it's warranted, all things considered.

Many Americans complain about undocumented immigration in the US. To be fair, the numbers are quite astonishing, and it's reasonable for any country to want to protect its borders.  
But let's be honest: whose fault is it? In my opinion, conservative Americans.

The US prides itself on being the land of the free and of small government. Well, guess what? This also makes it the best country to be an undocumented immigrant in and go undetected.

* A register of the population to keep track of residents (whether citizens or not)? Nah, that's un-American!
* A secure and mandatory photo ID card to reliably prove your identity? Hell no!
* An SSN that you can just make up or steal to convince an employer you're legal? Hell yeah!
* A law to make it mandatory for employers to *properly* check their employees' immigration status? That sounds like communism!
* Salary in cash to avoid detection? That's A-OK!

1k5q7x3,StoneColdNipples,1745381203.0,312,immigration,Should I even bother? Denied a Tourist Visa Without a Second Look,"When I was 2 years old, in 1994, my parents illegally brought me into the U.S. I had no say in it ‚Äî I was a toddler. I grew up in the U.S., went to school, made friends, lived a normal life. It was my home.

At 18, just before my 19th birthday in 2011, I made the incredibly difficult decision to *leave* the U.S. and return to Mexico ‚Äî on my own ‚Äî because I wanted to fix my status the right way. I didn‚Äôt want to continue living in the shadows. I thought that if I left and followed the rules, I could eventually return legally, however I was denied and I have been living in Mexico ever since.

Fourteen years later, I've built a solid, stable, and successful life in Mexico. I‚Äôm a **software developer**, my wife is a **sales operations manager at a cybersecurity company**, and we also earn extra income from **Airbnb rentals**. Together, we make **over $120,000 USD per year**, which is **about 10x the average family income in our area**. We own **property**, have **a car**, and are raising our kids in the best private schools.

Today, we applied for a U.S. tourist visa ‚Äî our first time doing so. I just wanted to visit, maybe take our kids to Disneyland someday, and see some of the places I grew up in.

We came prepared with **everything**:

* Employment letters
* Income proof
* Property documents
* Marriage certificate
* Our entire financial portfolio

We didn‚Äôt even get to show it.

The consular officer spent about **5 minutes scrolling and typing** on her screen before asking us just four questions:

1. What do you do for a living?
2. How long were you in the U.S.?
3. Do you have relatives in the U.S.?
4. Do you have a degree?

We answered honestly. No, I don‚Äôt have a degree.  I started working in tech without one after dropping out of school. She didn't even blink before handing us the standard **214(b) denial** ‚Äî claiming we didn‚Äôt demonstrate strong enough ties to return home.

She didn‚Äôt ask about our income, property, kids, travel history, nothing. She didn‚Äôt let us speak. She didn‚Äôt even look at the documents we brought.

What‚Äôs so frustrating is I know people who‚Äôve overstayed visas, have no degree, little income, no ties ‚Äî and they got approved. And guess what? They stayed. Meanwhile, I *left voluntarily* as a teen, have done everything above board for 14 years, and *I‚Äôm* considered a risk?

It honestly feels like I‚Äôm being punished for the decisions my parents made when I was a toddler.

So here‚Äôs my real question for anyone who‚Äôs been in similar shoes or knows the system better than I do:

* **Does a degree really weigh more than a high income, property ownership, family, and 14 years of clean living abroad?**
* **Am I going to be stuck with this stigma forever?**
* **Is it even worth reapplying or trying again ‚Äî or will my name just keep pulling up that old history no matter what?**
* **Has anyone overcome a similar situation and been approved? How?**

I‚Äôm not looking to immigrate. I‚Äôm not trying to stay. I have a better life where I am now ‚Äî I'm not going to leave my beach home and successful business to pick fruit for minimum wage in the States. But I‚Äôd like to *visit*, legally and with dignity. I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs even possible anymore.

Any advice or similar stories would be appreciated.
